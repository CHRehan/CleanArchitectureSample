# Android Clean Code 
This project is meant to demonstrate the Android MVVM Clean architecture in android with the help of all the latest components available.

## What is [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164)?
Clean architecture is a method of software development in which you should be able to identify what a program performs merely by looking at its source code. 
The programming language, hardware, and software libraries needed to achieve the programâ€™s goal should be rendered obsolete. 
Like other software design philosophies, Clean architecture aims to provide a cost-effective process for developing quality code that performs better, is easier to alter, and has fewer dependencies. Robert C. Martin established clean architecture and promoted it on his blog, [Uncle Bob, in 2011](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
